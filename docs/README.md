# Introduction

Vue.js accessible multiselect component made according to WAI-ARIA practices.

## Features

- ♿️ fully accessible to screen readers;
- ⌨️ supports keyboard navigation (there really a lot of keyboard shortcuts);
- 🔣 type-ahead to focus option that starts with typed symbols;
- 💅 style agnostic, so you can style it whatever you like (but including core.scss is highly encouraged);
